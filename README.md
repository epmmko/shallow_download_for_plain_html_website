This python code do a shallow download of all files for the old-style file sharing website.

It works best when "a href" tag links to a file directly for example `<a href="myutils.py">myutils.py</a>`

The websites that this code was tested for include
1) https://www.dj4e.com/code/http/
2) https://www.pg4e.com/code/

It is known to not work for a new website or the page that "a href" tag does not directly link to the file.
It does not work for github.com.
